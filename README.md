# AI-Powered Universal Cable Diagnostic Device

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced, AI-integrated device for diagnosing various types of cables (high-voltage cables, internet cables, fiber optics, and other services ) รง in both aerial and underground infrastructures worldwide. The device combines multi-cable type detection, AI-driven diagnostics, and an intuitive user interface for efficient cable management and maintenance.

## Key Features
- AI-powered multi-cable type detection and analysis
- Modular design for adaptability to aerial and underground scenarios
- Advanced sensors including GPR and acoustic technologies
- Augmented Reality (AR) interface for intuitive data visualization
- GPS integration for precise cable and fault mapping
- Environmental resilience for various weather conditions
- Predictive maintenance capabilities using AI algorithms
- Seamless integration with existing cable management systems

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, specific sensors for cable detection and voltage measurement.
- **Software:** Python for device programming, libraries for sensor communication.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** AI models for predictive analysis of cable status and anomaly detection.

## Installation and Configuration

1. **Hardware:**
   - Connect sensors to the Raspberry Pi following the provided connection diagram.
   - Ensure all cables are securely connected and undamaged.

2. **Software:**
   - Clone the project repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cable-monitoring.git
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd cable-monitoring
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **AI Integration:**
   - Train the AI model with historical data on cable failures and status (see AI Training section).
   - Configure the model on the device:
     ```python
     from ai_model import load_model
     model = load_model('path/to/your/model')
     ```

## AI Training

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect historical data on cable status and failures.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Use an AI framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to train the model with the collected data.
   - Save the trained model in a compatible format.

3. **Model Integration:**
   - Load the model onto the device for real-time analysis.

## Agile Methodology

1. **Planning:**
   - Define requirements and establish a development timeline.

2. **Iterative Development:**
   - Implement features in short iterations.
   - Test and adjust the device in each iteration.

3. **Review and Adaptation:**
   - Review progress and adjust the plan as necessary.
